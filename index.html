      <h1>Pep Talk âœŠ</h1>

      <h2>For those of us who haven't made it yet.</h2>
      <p>Being a maker/founder/whatever-er is a mental endurance contest. Sometimes I have to give myself a pep talk to bounce back from self-doubt. Do you want a pep talk too?</p>

        <p>Hey friend,</p>
        <p>Whenever you feel like you're lost in the dark, comparing yourself to the big winners who have it all figured out, remember this:</p>
        <p>None of them <i>started</i> with a fan following and huge monthly revenue. Sure, some of them picked up speed faster than others, but they still had to go through the slog.</p>
        <p>Maybe you're in the slog right now. Doubting yourself, getting little recognition for the work you do. You're in good company. The best success stories started there.</p>
        <p>If you're still trying and learning then you're on the right path. You will get there.</p>
