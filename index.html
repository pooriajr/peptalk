      <h1>Pep Talk âœŠ</h1>

      <h2>For those of us who haven't made it yet.</h2>
      <p>Being a maker/founder/whatever-er is a mental endurance contest. Sometimes I have to give myself a pep talk to bounce back from self-doubt. Do you want a pep talk too?</p>

        <p>Hey friend,</p>
        <p>Do you compare yourself to the big winners who have it all figured out? I know I do it all the time, and it can make me doubt myself. But we have to remind ourselves of this:</p>
        <p>None of those people you compare yourself to <i>started</i> with thousands of fans and $10K MMR. Sure, some of them picked up speed faster than others, but they still had to go through the <b>slog</b>.</p>
        <p>So don't compare their successes to your slog. Compare their slog to your slog, and you'll see that you're already on a similar path, just at an earlier point in the journey.</p>
        <p>Keep following that path, and you'll get to the success too.</p>
