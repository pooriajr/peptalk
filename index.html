        <p>If you feel like you're struggling in the dark, comparing yourself to the big winners who have it all figured out, remember this:</p>
        <p>They didn't start with a big fan following and huge monthly revenue. At some point they were struggling just as you are now.</p>
        <p>Everybody has to get through it in their own time, in their own way. It's not a sign of failure - it's a rite of passage.</p>
        <p>So keep going. You're doing great, really. ðŸ™‚</p>
