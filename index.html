      <h2>For those of us who haven't made it yet.</h2>
      <p>Self doubt is the bane of the self-driven creator. It's knocked me down plenty of times. But I've learned to bounce back to a happy and useful mindset by giving myself pep talks. Do you want a pep talk too?</p>

      <p>Here's a sample of the emails I'll be sending. ðŸ‘‡ If you want weekly encouragement like that, I'd love to have you on the list.</p>

        <p>Hey there,</p>
        <p>I got into this maker/founder game as a result of reading success stories. I saw people not too different from myself who decided to do things their way, and won.</p>
        <p>It was inspiring, but success stories don't always mix nicely with that human instinct of judging by comparison. They get us automatically comparing ourself, and the result is a sinking feeling that "I'm not as good as them". Self-doubt. Have you been there too?</p>
        <p>Of course, you already know that perspective is pure BS. It's born of survivorship bias, negativity bias, and other cognitive biases. Yet sometimes we accept it as truth, despite knowing better.</p>

        <p>Here's a more useful perspective to replace it with:</p>
        <p>If you could see the people behind those success stories <b>before</b> they made it big, you'd have a very different perspective. They'd probably look a lot like you do now: someone with big potential who hasn't quite cracked it yet.</p>
        <p>They're that same successful person you felt inferior to, just in a different phase of their life.</p>
        <p>They had to get through that phase to find their success, and so will you. And when you succeed, there'll be a bunch of newbies comparing themselves to your success story.</p>
