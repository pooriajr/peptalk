      <h2>For those of us who haven't made it yet.</h2>
      <p>Self doubt is the bane of the self-driven creator. It's knocked me down plenty of times. But I've learned to bounce back to a happy and useful mindset by giving myself pep talks. Do you want a pep talk too?</p>

      <p>Here's a sample of the emails I'll be sending. ðŸ‘‡ If you want weekly encouragement like that, I'd love to have you on the list.</p>

            <div>Subject: Are you comparing yourself to success stories?</div>

        <p>Hey there,</p>
        <p>Success stories are inspiring, but there's a catch: your brain automatically compares you to that story and judges you on it. Thanks, Brain!</p>
        <p>That judgement is BS of course. It's distorted by survivorship bias, negativity bias, and other cognitive biases. Brain doesn't care, it just does it automatically.</p>

        <p>But you can choose a better perspective to override it:</p>
        <p>Comparing your pre-success story to someone's post-success story is as inconclusive as it sounds.</p>
        <p>Instead, compare yourself to what they were doing <i>before they made it</i>: <br>Trying, Failing, Learning, Growing. If you're doing that, you're on the path to your own success story.</p>
        <br>
